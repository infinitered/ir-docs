# Advanced Usage

For users looking for more granular control over face detection or wanting to explore advanced features, this guide
dives deeper.

## 1. Direct Access to the Face Detector

For advanced scenarios, you might want direct access to the face detector instance. The `useFaceDetector` hook allows
you to get the instance and work with it directly.

```tsx

import {
  useFaceDetector,
  RNMLKitFaceDetectorOptions,
  RNMLKitFaceDetector
} from "@infinitered/react-native-mlkit-face-detection";

function AdvancedFaceComponent() {
  const faceDetector = useFaceDetector();

  // You can now call methods directly on the faceDetector instance
  // Example:
  const result = faceDetector.detectFaces('local_uri_of_your_image_uri');


  // or initialize the detector with or without custom options
  const initializeDetector = React.useCallback((options: RNMLKitFaceDetectorOptions | undefined) => {
    faceDetector.initialize(options);
  }, [faceDetector]);

  // rest of your component
}
```

:::tip
The `useFaceDetector` hook gives you maximum flexibility but requires a deeper understanding of the detector's API.
Always refer back to the official documentation if in doubt.
:::

## 2. Deferred Initialization

By default, the face detector initializes immediately upon the component's mount. However, in scenarios where you'd like
to defer this initialization (maybe due to performance considerations or user-triggered actions), you can do so by
setting the `deferInitialization` flag prop.

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <RNMLKitFaceDetectionContextProvider
      options={FACE_DETECTION_OPTIONS}
      deferInitialization
    >
      {/* rest of your app goes here */}
    </RNMLKitFaceDetectionContextProvider>
  );
}
```

Then, when you're ready to initialize the detector you can simply call the `initialize` method:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const detector = useFaceDetector();
  useEffect(() => {
    detector.initialize();
  }, []);

  //...rest of your component
}
```

:::caution
Remember that the face detector will not work until it's initialized.

Ensure that it's initialized before trying to detect faces with it.
